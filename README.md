# Elevate_Labs_Task-1
 Create a Simple Responsive Landing Page Using HTML &amp; CSS

I created a folder named `Task-1` and added two files inside it: `index.html` and `style.css`.
Then I started by setting up the basic HTML5 structure in `index.html` and linked the external CSS file in the `<head>` section. In the `<header>` section, later added a logo image and a navigation bar with links. Below the header, 
Further I created a hero section containing a heading, a paragraph, and a call-to-action button. I also added a footer with copyright text and social media links. After setting up the HTML structure, 
I moved to the `style.css` file to style the page. I applied background colors, fonts, and spacing to the body, arranged the header with Flexbox, and styled the hero section to make it visually appealing. I also styled the footer, including the social links. To make the page responsive,
I used Flexbox and media queries. Once the layout was ready, 
I opened `index.html` in Live Server, tested the design by resizing the browser window, and adjusted the CSS for better spacing, font sizes, and responsiveness. 
Finally, I verified that all links, images, and styles were working correctly and saved the project files.
